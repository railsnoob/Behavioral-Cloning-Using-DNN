Overview
---
In this project, clone driving behavior using deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks.

One way of teaching a Neural network to drive a car is to train it with data collected by watching a human driving a car. 

In this projects I:

1. drove a car around a simulated race track,
2. recorded images and steering angles from driving around the simulated track,
3. built and trained a convolutional neural network using Keras & tensorflow using the above data,
4. regressed the steering angle using the images as input,
5. pre-processed data, augmented data  and tuned the number of layers, size of filters of the neural network to improve performance of the system
6. tested the system by seeing how well it drives around the track on its own.

In this directory you will find the following:

1. Jupyter notebook containing the network that I used and the data prep-processing and augmentation
2. The video of the neural network driving around the racetrack on its own.
