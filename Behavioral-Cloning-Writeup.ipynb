    "## Rubric Points\n",
    "### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py  - containing the script to create and train the model\n",
    "* drive.py  - for driving the car in autonomous mode\n",
    "* model.h5  - containing a trained convolution neural network \n",
    "* writeup.md - This document. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Submission includes functional code\n",
    "Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python drive.py model.h5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable\n",
    "\n",
    "The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model consists of a convolution neural network with 5x5 filter sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I added dropout to minimize the error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code line 66), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 64). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 68). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 76-77). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 76).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of:\n",
    " center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road and drivign in both directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to iterate in two ways:\n",
    "1. Add dropout and scaling to help reduce overfitting and dimensionality \n",
    "2. Increase data samples by driving in both directions and adding samples where the car corrects from the side of the road to the center. \n",
    "3. Remove superfluous elements from the input (eg: trees etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to LeNet because it was something we had used before.  Since the output was a single element. The only difference being that we have to output a continuous variable instead of a discrete one. To do that I used the Mean Sqaured Error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that:\n",
    "1. I added dropout between convolutional layers\n",
    "2. Scaled the features \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track and to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I drove the car in both directions and I added instsances where the car drives from the side of the track to the center. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "model = Sequential()\n",
    "model.add(Lambda(lambda x: x/255.0-0.5,input_shape=(160,320,3)))\n",
    "model.add(Cropping2D(cropping=((70,25),(0,0))))\n",
    "model.add(Convolution2D(6,5,5,activation='relu'))\n",
    "model.add(MaxPooling2D())\n",
    "model.add(Dropout(0.2))\n",
    "model.add(MaxPooling2D())\n",
    "model.add(Dropout(0.2))\n",
    "model.add(Flatten())\n",
    "model.add(Dense(120))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(84))\n",
    "model.add(Dense(1))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to course correct when it went off the side of the road.  These images show what a recovery looks like starting from left side back to the center of the road:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment the data sat, I drove the car in the *reverse direction*. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the collection process, I had *9456* number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by converting the data into grayscale and scaling the image and cutting out the trees and other supefluous elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 3 as evidenced by the validation and test error increasing after that.  I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary."
